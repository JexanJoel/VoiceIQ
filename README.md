## 🇮🇳 The Problem

Indian call centers handle thousands of calls daily. Supervisors manually listen to recordings to check compliance — slow, inconsistent, expensive, and completely incompatible with Hinglish and Tanglish speech.

**VoiceIQ automates this entirely.** Upload a call recording → get a full compliance report in under 30 seconds. No manual listening. No missed violations. No bias.

## ✨ Features

#### 🗣️ Hinglish & Tanglish STT
Groq Whisper large-v3 transcribes mixed-language Indian call recordings with high accuracy - no manual effort.

#### ✅ SOP Compliance Validation
Every call is scored against your custom SOP rules. Violations are flagged with exact rule references, timestamps, and severity levels.

#### 😊 Sentiment Analysis
Detect caller mood and agent tone across every interaction. Spot negative patterns before they escalate.

#### 💳 Payment Preference Detection
Automatically categorize whether customers prefer EMI, Full Payment, Partial Payment, or Down Payment.

#### 🚩 Instant Call Flagging
Calls below 70% SOP compliance are automatically flagged for manager review — zero manual listening. Mark calls as reviewed to track progress.

#### 📊 Live Analytics Dashboard
Real-time charts on compliance trends, sentiment distribution, language breakdown, and payment preferences. Includes best/worst performing day and most violated rule.

#### 👤 Agent Performance Tracking
Leaderboard ranked by compliance %, with trend arrows (↑↓→), per-agent violations, sentiment trends, and full call history.

#### 📋 Custom SOP Rules Manager
Define your own compliance rules per category — greeting, identity, payment, closing, and more. Up to 10 rules. Shows violation count per rule.

#### 🎙️ Audio Player
Listen to the original call recording side by side with the AI transcript. Click any violation timestamp to jump directly to that moment in the audio.

#### 💡 AI Coaching Suggestions
Every violation includes a specific, actionable coaching tip — with example scripts the agent can use next time.

#### ⚠️ Violation Severity Levels
Each violation is classified as Critical, Major, or Minor — sorted by severity so the most important issues surface first.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Upload audio file (MP3 / WAV / M4A)
        ↓
Saved to Supabase Storage (private bucket)
        ↓
Groq Whisper transcribes → auto-detects language + generates timestamped segments
        ↓
Custom SOP rules fetched from DB (or defaults used)
        ↓
Llama 3.3 70B analyzes timestamped transcript against SOP rules
        ↓
Returns: compliance %, violations (with timestamps + severity + coaching),
         sentiment, payment preference, passed checks, summary
        ↓
Results saved to DB → displayed on dashboard with audio player
```

```
calls       — recordings, transcripts, compliance results, agent assignment, reviewed status
agents      — agent profiles per user account
sop_rules   — custom SOP rules per user (max 10)
```

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled via Supabase.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

**Dashboard Home** — Stats overview, compliance trend chart, best/worst day, most violated rule

**All Calls** — Upload calls, assign agents, filter by date, view all recordings

**Call Detail** — Audio player with clickable violation timestamps, severity badges, coaching tips, transcript

**Flagged Calls** — Calls below 70% compliance, filter by reviewed/pending, mark as reviewed

**Agents** — Leaderboard with trend arrows, per-agent compliance, sentiment, top violation

**SOP Rules** — Create/edit/toggle rules, violation count per rule, default rules preview

## 🔐 Authentication

- Email and password with confirmation
- Google OAuth one-click sign in
- All routes protected via Supabase Auth
- JWT passed as Bearer token to backend on every request

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JexanJoel/VoiceIQ.git
cd VoiceIQ
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in your `.env`:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_API_URL=https://your-render-backend-url.onrender.com
```

### 4. Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔗 Backend Repository

The backend API (Node.js + Express + Groq) is in a separate repository:

👉 **[VoiceIQ Backend](https://github.com/JexanJoel/VoiceIQ-backend)**

The backend exposes `POST /api/call-analytics` — the hackathon evaluation endpoint that accepts Base64 MP3 audio and returns structured compliance JSON.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Audio files above ~25MB may hit Whisper API limits
- Very noisy recordings reduce transcription accuracy
- Frontend requires an active backend on Render (free tier may cold-start on first request — allow ~30s)
